Breast Cancer Classifier

This is a machine learning project I completed in Python. I believe it is a very common beginner project using the Scikit-Learn Breast Cancer data.

The purpose of this project is to do the following:
1. Load the Breast Cancer data. (not using Pandas this time)
2. Preview the data. (no prepocessing needed)
3. Split the data between training and validation sets using train_test_split() from Scikit-Learn.
4. Initialize variables to be used for finding the most accurate number of neighbors for the K Nearest Neighbors classifier model.
5. Create the KNN Classifier model and fit it to the training data, then use it on the validation data and see how accurate it is.
6. Plot the accuracies of the model depending on the number of neighbors used for classification using Matplotlib.
7. Based on the plot, choose the optimum number of neighbors and create a new classification model using that number.
